# Available and Reusable Badges

We are applying for the *Available* and *Reusable* artifact badges.
We believe that our artifact deserves the available badge because
we provide open access to the source code of PyCG and to all the data
that were used during evaluation, namely a micro- and a macro-benchmark,
as well as the scripts that produce the evaluation results.
We believe that our artifact deserves the reusable badge because other
researchers can reuse the materials we provide with minimal requirements.
Specifically, the artifact can be used for facilitating further studies
based on the generation of Python call graphs or the evaluation of
call graph generators.
